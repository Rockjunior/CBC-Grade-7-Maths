Number sequence   A number sequence is a list of numbers that follow a specific pattern or rule.  Think of it like a list of numbers where each number is related to the one before it in a certain way e.g Here, you are adding 2 each time. These are all numbers that can be divided by 2.  The pattern could involve adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing by a certain number each time.    Identifying a number sequence     Look for the pattern. Identify if the numbers are increasing or decreasing. Find out if there is consistent amount being added or subtracted.  See if you can predict the next number based on the rule you find.    1. Working in groups of , each group to write down the following sequence:     Sequence: ,___    Sequence: ,___    Sequence: , ____    Sequence: , ___     2. Each team to take minutes to solve each question and work together to identify the pattern and fill in the missing number.  3. At the end of 3 minutes, each group will present their answer to the class.  4. The group should explain the pattern they identified that is why it works and how they figured it out.  5. Discuss where you see number patterns in nature, technology, and everyday life.      Identify the missing number in the following sequences.   ,___,___,___    1. The first step is to find the differences between consecutive numbers:                     So, the differences are which are increasing by each time.  2. Next step is to predict the next differences:      (the next difference)     (the following difference)     (the last difference)     3.Add these differences to the last known number (1400):                     So the missing numbers are   4. Finally, the sequence is       Rearrange the following numbers in ascending order and identify the next two numbers in each sequence.       The given numbers are: .  When rearranged in ascending order, we get:   .  Now, let's examine the relationship between the numbers:                          From the above,each number is being multiplied by 3 to get the next number.  Therefore, the next numbers are:                The missing numbers are       Creating a number sequence  To create a number sequence, you need the first number in the sequence and the rule connecting the next numbers.      There are 6 students in the class, and each student adds 2 books to a table. The 1st student places books, the 2nd student places another , and so on.  1. Record the total number of books as each student adds books on the table after each turn.  2. Figure out the sequence of books on the table and explore how patterns form.  3.Create different sequences using the same setup by changing the rules for adding books and generate new sequences i.e     Add an increasing number of books each time - this is a sequence where the 2nd student add 2, then third student 3, then forth student 4, and so on.    Each student can multiply the number of books added by the previous student like if previous student places books the nextm will place then the next will place .     Each group to share their sequences with the class and explain the rule or pattern they used to generate their sequence .      Create a number sequence that starts at 60,000 upto the fifth term and follows the rule of dividing by 5.    Since we have the 1st term and a rule, we can calculate the subsequent terms.    First term:     Second term:     Third term:     Fourth term:     Fifth term:      The final sequence is:       Morara is a businessman. Every day, he deposits sh into his bank account. Create a pattern to show his bank account balance at the end of each day for one week.    Assume Morara starts with 0 shillings in his account at the beginning.  A week has days and his account balance on the first day is sh .     Day 1:     Day 2:     Day 3:     Day 4:     Day 5:     Day 6:     Day 7:      Therefore, the sequence of Morara's bank account balance at the end of each day for one week is:               "

Expressing composite numbers as a product of prime factors   Composite numbers are numbers that has more than two factors,meaning it can be divided evenly by numbers other than and itself.  Process of breaking a composite number is prime factorization and prime factorization expresses the number as the product of prime numbers.     Factors of composite numbers  Factors are numbers that can divide a given number without leaving a remainder. Factors are also called divisors.  Tumaini school is planning a sports day and Kamau needs to organize students into equal-sized teams. There are students in his class. Kamau needs factors of to divide the students into equal teams so that no one is left out.  Since the factors of are and . It gives Kamau possible ways to divide the students into equally.    List all the factors of each of the following numbers.                        To determine the factors of , we need to identify all numbers between and that divide exactly, leaving no remainder.  We check the divisibility of each number step by step:      divides exactly: . Therefore, is a factor of .     divides exactly: . Therefore, is a factor of .     does not divide exactly: with a remainder of . Therefore, is not a factor of .     divides exactly: . Therefore, is a factor of .     We continue this process for other numbers to check if they divide without leaving a remainder.  After completing the checks, we find that and all divide exactly.  Therefore, the factors of are and .       Another way to find the factors of a number is by identifying pairs of numbers that, when multiplied together, produce that number. If , then both and are factors of .  To determine the factors of , we find all pairs of numbers whose product equals :            Since we have identified all factor pairs of , we can list its factors as follows:  The factors of are and .         Exercise for Factors goes here.       Prime factors  Let's start by defining what are prime numbers. Prime numbers are positive whole numbers that are greater than 1, that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller numbers. Examples of prime numbers are   A prime factor is a prime number that can divide a given number without a remainder.  Example in real life:  Okuse, an architect want to design a strong and beautiful classroom. To make sure the classroom is stable, Okuse use blocks of the strongest materials. Now, think of prime numbers as the strongest building block in mathematics such that if we want to know what the number is made of we break it down into it's prime factors.  Start with         Therefore, prime factors of are          Observe the groupings carefully and determine the total number of groupings as well as the number of circles or dots in each group.      Click on the blank boxes provided. Type in the correct factors that multiply to give the number shown. Ensure at least one of the numbers entered is a prime factor.      Once you have entered the factors, click the CHECK button to verify your response.  If your factors are correct, a confirmation message will appear or another prompt will appear for continuation if you haven't exhausted all the prime factors.  If your factors are incorrect, reanalyze the groupings and enter the new factors again.      What did you notice about the clusters of dots?  How did you use the dots to help find the factors?      After completing successfully in finding the factors of the given number , click the NEW PROBLEM button to attempt another visualization.                  Express as a product of its prime factors.    To break down into its prime factors, we need to find which prime numbers multiply together to give us .   Remember: Always start with the smallest prime number (which is ). If the number isn’t divisible by , move to the next prime number ( , then , and so on) until you can’t divide further.  We start with the smallest prime number, which is . Let's divide by : . Since it divides exactly, is our first prime factor.  Next, we take and divide it by again: . It divides exactly, so is our second prime factor.  Now, we take and divide it by once more: . It divides exactly, so is our third prime factor.  Next, we take and divide it by again: . It divides exactly, so is our fourth prime factor.  Finally, we have , which is already a prime number and cannot be divided further.  So, the prime factors of are: .         24     12     6     3     1           Express as a product of its prime factors.    To find the prime factors of , we will use a factor tree. A factor tree helps us break down a composite number into its prime factors step by step.  Here’s how the factor tree for looks:      We start by breaking into and . Then, is broken into and , and finally, is broken into and . Since is a prime number, we stop here.  We can't factor any more, so we have found the prime factors.  Therefore, the product of prime factors of is :        Greatest Common Divisor  GCD is the largest positive integer number that divides evenly into two or more numbers with zero remainder. It is also known as the Highest Common Factor (HFC).  Example in real life:  Esther and Shillah have packets of snacks and want to share them equally amoung the top mathematics performers in grade without leaving leftovers. Esther have crackers and Shillah has cookies.  The largest number of top performers Shillah and Esther can gift is solved using GCD.  Since the factors of are and the factors of are . This implies that the higher number of top performers to be gifted is .         Form groups of five learners , count and record the total number of girls and boys in your class.      List all the factors of each number.      Identify and circle the factors that are common to all the numbers.      Determine the Greatest Common Factor (GCD) by selecting the largest common factor.      Present your group's findings to the rest of the class.       Find the GCD of     To find the GCF by factoring, list out all of the factors of each number  The divisors of are .  The divisors of are .  The divisors of are .  The common factors of are .  The greatest common factor of is .      Three sticks of lengths cm, cm and cm are cut into smaller pieces of the length. Find the greatest length which can be cut without leaving a remainder.    To determine the greatest length which can be cut without leaving a remainder, we need to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the three numbers.    prime factors for 30        prime factors for 45        prime factors for 60        The prime factorization of is .  The prime factorization of is .  The prime factorization of is .  The common prime factors of , and are and .  Thus, the greatest common factor of , and is .  The greatest length which can be cut from each stick without leaving a remainder is cm.      Exercise for GCD goes here.      Least Common Multiple  The Least Common Multiple of two or more numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by two or more numbers without a reminder. The Least Common Multiple (LCM) is also referred to as the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) and Least Common Divisor (LCD).  Example:  Murunga and Onyimbo have busy schedules but want to meet regularly for a football game. Murunga have free time every days and Onyimbo has free time every days. To find when they will both be free on the same day to play, we solve using LCM.  Therefore, we list the multiples of Murunga's free days: and Onyimbo's free days:   The common multiples are and the smallest commom multiple is .  Hence Muranga and Onyimbo will both be free on the th day to play football game.      Click on the first dropdown next to Multiples of and scroll to select the any number.  After selecting a number, - and + buttons will appear. Click the + button to add multiples of the selected number. To remove a listed multiple, click the - button.  Keep clicking the + button until you have added at least multiples for the chosen number.

What is the shortest possible length of a ribbon that can be cut into equal pieces of cm, cm or cm without a remainder?    To determine the shortest possible length of the ribbon that can be cut into equal pieces of cm, cm, and cm without a remainder, we need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.     Write down your numbers in a top table row    Starting with the lowest prime numbers, divide the row of numbers by a prime number that is evenly divisible into at least one of your numbers and bring down the result into the next table row.    If any number in the row is not evenly divisible just bring down that number.    Continue dividing rows by prime numbers that divide evenly into at least one number    When the last row of results is all 's you are done.

Circle     Circle           Arranging fractions in ascending order  Arranging fractions in ascending order means arranging fractions from smallest to greatest in value.  To arrange fractions in order, we need to make sure they all have the same numerator or the same denominator. This makes it easier to compare them and put them in the correct sequence.  When fractions have the same denominator, the numerators are compared. The greater the numerator, the greater the fraction. Also, when fractions have the same numerators, the denominators are compared. The greater the denominators, the smaller the fraction.

Consider a surveyor tasked with determining the side length of a square garden with an area of m . Since all sides of a square are equal, the surveyor needs to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, results in . This is where the concept of square roots comes into play.  To find the side length of the garden, the surveyor needs to determine the square root of . In this case, the square root of is since , meaning each side of the garden is m long.  We can represent this mathematically as follows:       A square garden   A square with side length a        Area of a square = side length side length     , where represents the side length of the square.        Squares of whole numbers  Whole numbers are set of numbers including and positive integers. They don't contain decimals, fraction or negative integers. Whole numbers are also called counting numbers. i.e   We find the square of a whole number, by multiplying the whole number by itself, the resulting product is called the square number. In particular, the operation of multiplying a whole number with itself can be expressed with an exponent of 2.  For example, the square of can be expressed as and .     Work in groups      Draw a grid of squares like the one shown below.      Start by counting all the smallest squares in the grid.      Then, identify and count all the larger squares, such as  , and so on, until you reach the largest square that fits within the grid.      Write down the number of squares for each size in a table for better organization. Add them up to find the total number of squares in the grid.      Discuss your findings in a small group. Compare how many squares each of you found and check for any missed squares.      Think about the process you used to count the squares. Could there be a quicker way to calculate the total number of squares without counting each one individually?              What is the square of ?       The square of a number is obtained by multiplying the number by itself.  Now, express as .  Then, perform multiplication.                               The length of a square floor tile is cm. What is the area of the tile?                             The area of the floor tile is       Exercise on squares of whole numbers goes in here.      Squares of fractions  We have seen how to find squares of whole numbers . But what about fractions? A fraction contains of a numerator and a denominator, both of which are whole numbers. Squaring a fraction follows the same way as squaring whole numbers, in which we simply multiply both the numerator and the denominator by themselves.

Share your work with other learners in class       Work out the square of:                 To square a fraction, square both the numerator (top number) and the denominator (bottom number).  Square the numerator:  Square the denominator:  Combine the squared numerator and denominator to form the new fraction.          Work out the following:                Convert the mixed fraction to an improper fraction.     Find the square of the improper fraction by squaring both the numerator and denominator.     Convert the improper fraction to a mixed fraction.         Exercise for squares of fractions goes in here.      Squares of decimals  Squaring a decimal number means multiplying the decimal number by itself. To do this, multiply the number by itself, then count the total decimal places in the original numbers and apply the same number of decimal places in the final product. Alternatively, we can convert the decimal into a fraction, square the fraction, and then simplify it back to a decimal number.  The square of a decimal number should have double the number of decimal places as the original number.         Drag both sliders so they have the same value.      click the MULTIPLY button.

There are several approaches that one can use to find the square of   In this approach, we convert to a fraction.   Then, we square the fraction , multiply the numerator by itself and the denominator by itself.   We finally convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator.          What is the value of ?          To find we need to calculate  Convert to a whole number by multiplying it by 100.   Then, we have:                           Since we initially removed two decimal places from each number (multiplying by 100 for both), we must divide the final result by to restore the decimal:            Exercise for squares of decimals goes here      Squares roots of whole numbers  The square root of a number is the inverse operation of squaring a number. The square of a number is the value that is obtained when we multiply the number by itself, while the square root of a number is obtained by finding a number that when squared gives the original number.  We represent the square root of a number using this symbol . For example, square root of 4, we represent it as   To find the square root of a number, we just see by squaring which number would give the original number. It is very easy to find the square root of a number that is a perfect square. Perfect squares are those positive numbers that can be expressed as the product of a number by itself.     Work in groups      Draw the following grid pattern in your exercise books or on graph paper, as the one shown below.

We can express the given decimal number as a fraction and then find the square roots of the numerator and denominator separately. We then simplify the resulting fraction and convert it back into a decimal number.         Drag both sliders so they have the same value.      click the MULTIPLY button.      What did you observe from the shaded region in the three squares.      Click START AGAIN button and repeate the process with different decimal values              Work out:              Since can be written as the fraction , we take the square root of both the numerator and the denominator separately.     Here, we express and in terms of their prime factors to simplify the square root calculation.     Select one factor from each pair and multiply the selected factors.     Divide the results:             Exercise to be included in here.     "

This idea is the foundation of linear equations.    What is a Linear Equation?   A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. It has a simple form, such as:     Here, is the unknown number, called a variable. To find , we solve the equation step by step:              This means the value of that makes the equation true is    Why are Linear Equations Important?   Linear equations help us solve real-world problems, such as:    Calculating expenses: If a book costs dollars and you buy books, the total cost is . If the total cost is , you can find the price of one book by solving .     Finding unknown ages: If a person's age is , and their younger sibling is years younger, we can write this as      Distance and speed calculations: If a car travels at km per hour for hours, the distance covered is km.     You are going to learn how to:    Understand equations – Recognizing how equations express equality.     Solve for unknowns – Finding the value of variables step by step.     Use real-life applications – Applying equations to everyday situations.     Graph linear equations – Representing equations on a coordinate plane.     Linear equations are like puzzles waiting to be solved. With practice, you will see how they can make problem-solving easier and fun.

  "title": "Linear Inequalities",
  "body": " Linear Inequalities    Introduction to Linear Inequalities   In everyday life, we often come across situations where things are not exactly equal but instead follow a comparison. For example, if a bus can carry at most 50 passengers, it means the number of passengers should be less than or equal to 50. Similarly, if a student must be older than 12 years to join a club, it means their age must be greater than 12.  Mathematics helps us express such comparisons using inequalities .  An inequality is a mathematical statement that shows the relationship between two values when they are not equal. Unlike equations, which use the equal sign ( = ), inequalities use special symbols to compare values:      Greater than  : Example: means is any number greater than , but is not included.     Less than  : Example: means is any number less than , also in this case is not included.     Greater than or equal to  : Example: means is either or any number greater than .     Less than or equal to  : Example: means is either or any number less than .      What Are Linear Inequalities?   A linear inequality is an inequality that involves a linear expression. It is similar to a linear equation but uses inequality symbols instead of an equal sign.  For example:                Just like linear equations, linear inequalities can be solved by performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, one key difference is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality sign must be reversed.   Why Are Inequalities Important?   Inequalities help us solve real-world problems, such as:     Determining budget constraints (e.g., \"You can spend at most $100.\")    Setting age limits (e.g., \"You must be at least 18 years old to vote.\")    Calculating time constraints (e.g., \"The train arrives in less than 30 minutes.\")    Describing physical limits (e.g., \"A container can hold no more than 5 liters of water.\")     We are goin to learn how to solve and illustrate linear inequalities in numberlines, understand their applications, and use them to make informed decisions in various situations.

It has a zero in the center, with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left.    The numbers increase as we move to the right and decrease as we move to the left.    The numbers are evenly spaced on the line.     Take a look at the numberline below:   Number Line Illustrastion.      Work in Groups.      Consider x > 2.     Draw a number line.    Identify some of the numbers that satisfy the inequality.    Confirm whether the numbers are to the left or right of digit 2.    Circle digit 2.    From the circle, draw an arrow facing the direction with numbers which satisfy the inequality.    Discuss and share with others.

The longest side of the right triangle (the side opposite the angle) is called the hypotenuse and the other two (shorter) sides are called the legs of the triangle.    The legs of a right triangle are commonly labelled and while the hypotenuse is labeled .           The Pythagorean relationship is a special rule about right-angled triangles. It helps us find the length of one side if we know the other two sides.  We use the Pythagorean relationship in many real-life situations, such as:       A long time ago, about 2000 years back, people discovered something amazing about right-angled triangles. They found that:     In other words, the two small squares together are exactly the same size as the big square.   The ubove description for about 2000 years   This special rule is called the Pythagorean Theorem, and we write it as:   Where,   and are the shorter sides of the triangle.   is the longest side (called the hypotenuse).

When calculating the area of a parallelogram ensure you use the formula Area     For any drawn figure ensure you've obtained both the base and height before incoopereting the formula.       Area of a rhombus  A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral that is a special kind of parallelogram. The key characteristics of a rhombus are:     Opposite sides are parallel.    All sides have equal length.    Opposite angles are equa and adjacent angles are supplementary (they add up to ).    The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90°), meaning they intersect at a right angle and divide each other into two equal parts.     The formula for the area of a rhombus can be given in two common ways:     Using the diagonals:   where:   and are the lengths of the two diagonals.    Using the base and height:   Where the base is the length of any side (since all sides are equal) and the height is the perpendicular distance between opposite sides.       Perimeter of different plane figures.       Calculate the area of the figure given it's diagonals are and .   Rhombus     Area of a rhombus short diagonals long diagonal.         Calculate the area of each rhombus.            (a)  Area of a rhombus by the base and height: .     (b)         Area of trapeziam  The trapezium is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel opposite sides. The parallel sides of a trapezium are called bases and the non-parallel sides of a trapezium are called legs. It is also called a trapezoid. Sometimes the parallelogram is also called a trapezoid with two parallel sides.     From the above figure, we can see, sides AB and CD are parallel to each other whereas AD and BC are non-parallel sides. Also, ‘h’ is the distance between the two parallel sides which demonstrates the height of the trapezium.  There are many real-life examples of trapezium shape that we can see around us. For example, a table whose surface is shaped like a trapezium.   trapezium         Area of Trapezium   Which can be written as A   where: is the sum of the parallel sides and is the perpendicular height of the trapezium.

It teaches us how to read thermometers, work with negative numbers, and even convert between Degrees Celsius and kelvins.  Have you ever wondered why some countries use different temperature units? Or why water freezes at 0°C but boils at 100°C? Learning about temperature isn’t just about numbers—it helps us understand the world around us. So, next time you check the weather, think about how math is helping you plan your day!    Comparing temperatures   Why do we say it’s ‘as cold as ice’ but never ‘as hot as fire’?

An angle is represented by the symbol   Angles are formed when two lines intersect at point (also known as vertex ). In geometry, an angle is formed when two rays are joined at their endpoints. Rays are also known as sides or arms of the angle.  Observe the diagram below.   angles(Created with GeoGebra®,[Geogebra Content Team])    lIne and intersect at point to form  , shaded in red.     Here is an interactive activity for you to explore the different types of angles.  Use the spy glass by dragging it over the objects in the given picture. You can click on the 'NEW PICTURE' button to get a new image.   Angles    What angles have you discovered from this activity?  Now, explore the objects around you and find the different types of angles in your sorrounding. What angles did you find?   Learning Point.   Did you know one of the real life applications of angles is in Carpentary?   For example, when carpenters are making a chair, they use angles to cut the wood so that the legs of the chair slants at the desired angle thereby creating a stable and beautiful designs.  They typically use a combination of measuring tools, like a protractor and a combination square, to mark the angles on the wood before cutting, often aiming for a slight outward slant on the legs for stability and comfort     True\/False  definition of angles   Angles are formed when two rays intersect at a vertex. The opening between the two rays is called an angle, represented by a symbol     An angle is described as a 'opening' formed by two rays\/lines meeting at a vertex.    Refer to the definition in the introduction section , .      Angles in a straight line    What you need: a ruler and a protractor    line       Draw a straight line and mark point at the centre as shown above.    Draw two lines to make an angle with line at point as shown in the diagram below.      Measure the angles you have drawn.    How do the angles relate to each other?            Learning point   Angles on a straight line always add up to . This is because a straight line itself is considered a \"straight angle\" which measures exactly .  Any two angles that add up to are supplementary angles.      Calculate the size of the angle labeled in the figure below.   Angles on a straight line.      Angles on a straight line add upto   The angle can be solved by adding ;  Equating ,we get;             Angles in a straight line(Created with GeoGebra®,[Geogebra Content Team])        Angles at a point.

Therefore:                  Angles at a point        Complementary and supplimentary angles  Angles that add together to make a straight line are called supplementary angles. If you know one supplementary angle you can subtract it from 180° to find a missing angle.    Here is an activity for you to explore on supplementary and complementary angles.

Complementary and supplimentary angles(Created with GeoGebra®,[Geogebra Content Team])     What do you notice from this activity?      Angles on a transversal   A transversal is any line that intersects two straight lines at distinct points.  When a transversal cuts two parallel lines, several angles are formed by these two intersections. Those are called transversal angles. Those types of angles on a transversal are given below:     Corresponding angles    Co-interior Angles    Alternate interior angles    Alternate Exterior angles       Corresponding angles    Corresponding angles are the angles which are formed in matching corners or corresponding corners with the transversal when two parallel lines are intersected by any other line (i.e. the transversal).

  "body": " Geometrical constructions   Geometrical construction is the process of creating geometric shapes, figures, or diagrams using basic tools, like a compass, ruler and protractor. The goal is to draw precise shapes without measurements, relying on rules of geometry. Examples of geometric constructions include drawing a line segment, bisecting an angle, or constructing a perpendicular e.t.c    Measuring angles     Measuring angles is a significant topic in geometry. An angle can be measured using a protractor. An angle is measured in degrees, hence its called degree measure. One complete revolution is equal to , hence it is divided into parts. Each part of the revolution is a degree. If we know how to measure angle, then it will be very easy to construct an angle using a protractor.    A protractor is a semi-circular tool used to draw and measure angles. It is marked with degrees from to . It can be directly used to measure any angle from to . The markings are made in two ways, to from right to left and vice versa.         Click on the New Angle button.    Using the protractor, measure the size of the angle.    Enter the value and click on Check.    Repeat the process several times to ensure that you understand how to use a protractor.           Suppose we have an angle to measure say, . Follow the steps given below to measure the angle.     Put the protractor above the line such that the midpoint of protractor is at point .    Adjust the protractor in such a way that is parallel to the straight-edge of the protractor.    The protractor has two scales marked from to on both the ends. Take the reading where coincides with the .    Now from , check the line coincides with the curved edges of the protractor. This reading gives us the measure of angle .                       Bisecting angles  What is an angle bisector ?  An angle bisector or the bisector of an angle is a line that divides an angle into two equal parts. For example, In the applet below, the blue line is said to be an angle bisector of angle .  The gray slider adjusts the entire measure of angle .  The black slider dynamically illustrates what it means for a line to bisect an angle.        How to construct an angle bisector?  You require a ruler and a compass to construct angles and their bisectors. Given a known or unknown , the steps to construct its angle bisector are:        Place the compass pointer at and make an arc that cuts the two arms of the angle at two different points.       From the point where the first arc cut the arm , make another arc towards the interior of the angle.       Without changing the radius on the compass, repeat step from the point where the first arc cut .       Using a ruler, draw a line from to the point where the arcs intersect.        The line that was drawn through represents the angle bisector of the .  Note: If an angle bisector bisects a line segment at , it is known as the perpendicular bisector of that line.  The figure below shows a Perpendicular Bisector of a Line Segment                If an angle bisector divides an angle of degrees, then what is the measure of each angle?    Given, a measure of an angle is   As we know, the angle bisector divides the angle into equal two parts.  Therefore, is divided into equal two parts, say .  Hence,                  Geometrical construction of   Drawing Angles Game      Draw angles as accurately as you can and improve your angle sense in this interactive game.(Drawing angles by estimation)             Which angles were the easiest for you to draw?

  "body": " Data handling   Meaning of data  Data is a collection of facts such as numbers and measurements that we learn, make decisions or solve problems.  An example of data in a classroom could be the information on finding out how many pens each group in the classroom has. Here is the data we collected:     Group Names: Group 1, Group 2, Group 3    Number of Pens:      Group 1: 5 pens    Group 2: 8 pens    Group 3: 7 pens     This information is considered data because counting pens helps us manage and organize our resources effectively. For instance, if one group needs more pens, we can identify which group has extra pens to share. You could use this data to figure out things like:  Which group has the most pens?  How many pens are there in total?  What is the average number of pens per group?     Work in groups  (i) Each learner state their understanding of the term data.  (ii) Search for the meaning of data from different sources.  (iii) Discuss and compare with other groups.   Learning point     Data is a collection of facts such as numbers and measurements collected to represent information.       Collection of data  A collection of data refers to the process of gathering and assembling relevant pieces of information or facts from various sources for analysis or use.  This data can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (descriptive) and is typically organized in a structured manner to allow for efficient examination or decision-making.  Data collection can take many forms, such as:  Surveys and questionnaires: Gathering responses from individuals  Experiments: Recording observations or measurements during controlled experiments.  Interviews: Collecting qualitative data through direct interactions.     Work in groups  (i) Collect data on the number of classrooms in your school.  (ii) Count the number of textbooks for each subject in your class.  (iii) Collect data on the number of male and female in your class.  (iv) Collect information on the number of left handed students in your class.  (v) Discuss and compare with other groups.   Learning point     Data collected from different situations vary from each other.       Frequency distribution table  A frequency distribution table displays the frequency of each data set in an organized way.  Frequency is the rate at which something occurs over a particular period of time or in a given sample.  It helps us to find patterns in the data and also enables us to analyze the data using measures of central tendency and variance.   Work in groups  (i) Consider the following list showing the favourite fruits for learners.   Frequency distribution table    Learner  Fruit    Kemunto  Banana    Otieno  Apple    Kamau  Apple    Esipisu  Banana    Omar  Guava    Sidika  Apple    Nanjala  Guava    Njoki  Banana    Sagar  Guava    Baraza  Banana    Anyango  Banana    Issa  Banana     (ii) Represent the information in a table that has Fruit, Tally and Frequency.  (iii) Compare and discuss with other groups.   Learning points     A tally mark represents one unit. One mark represent a frequency of one.    A table having one unit and the number of times it occurs is a frequency table       The height, in centimetres, of 30 tree seedlings were recorded as follows:  15 20 18 15 20 15 16 14 20 14 12 14 15 16 10  12 10 16 18 15 16 11 13 16 14 12 17 16 20 19  Draw a frequency distribution table to represent this information.

(iii) Discuss and compare with other groups.   Learning point     A suitable scale should be chosen in such a way that data is easy to plot and easy to read.       Pictographs of data  A pictograph is a type of data visualization that uses pictures or symbols to represent and convey data.  Each picture or symbol typically represents a specific quantity or value, making it easier to understand and interpret data.   Work in groups  (i) Consider the table shown   Favourite musical instrument    🎸  😊😊😊😊    🥁  😊😊    🎹  😊😊😊    🪈  😊😊😊😊😊     key: 😊represents four children  (ii) Write down the number of children whose favourite musical instrument is: (a) Guitar (b) Drum (c) Keyboard (d) Flute  (iii) Discuss and compare with other groups.   Learning point     A pictograph is a representation of data using images, icons and symbols.

(b) On which day were the most books borrowed?  (c) How many books were borrowed in total during the week?  (d) How many more books were borrowed on Friday compared to Thursday?    (a) Therefore, 50 books were borrowed on Monday  (b) Friday  (c) Total Books Borrowed:     Monday: 50 books    Tuesday: 40 books    Wednesday: 60 books    Thursday: 30 books    Friday: 70 books     Total =   Therefore, books were borrowed throughout the week.  (d) More Books Borrowed on Friday than Thursday:     Friday: 70 books    Thursday: 30 books    Difference = books         Bar graphs of data  Bar graph is a visual representation of data where individual bars (rectangular shapes) are used to represent the values or frequencies of different categories.  The length or height of each bar corresponds to the value it represents, making it easy to compare different categories.   Work in groups  (i) Consider the table below showing the number of loaves of bread sold in a school canteen in a week.
